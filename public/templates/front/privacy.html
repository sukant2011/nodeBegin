Personal Information may also include demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when that information is linked to other Personal Information that identifies the individual or that allows that individual to be identified. Personal Information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Corsa Services or about a group or category of products, services, or users, if all personally identifiable information has been removed or disassociated from the individual.</p>
